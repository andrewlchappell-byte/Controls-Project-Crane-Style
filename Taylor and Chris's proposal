Subject: Proposal for an autonomously controlled single-axis gantry crane capable of detecting obstacles, adjusting the hoist height to clear them, and completing a horizontal transfer.

\section{System Overview}
The system consists of a trolley that moves along a single horizontal axis ($x$) on a rail system, with a hoist enabling vertical motion ($z$) of a suspended payload. One or more fixed obstacles of height $h_b$ may be located along the track at positions $x_b$, $x_b+1$, ect. The control system detects the obstacle, raises the load to a safe pass-over height, traverses horizontally, and lowers the payload afterward.

Primary sensing and actuation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Height measurement: ultrasonic measuring distance from trolley to load.
\item obstacle detection: ultrasonic sensors before and after load position.
\item Microcontroller: ESP32 running MicroPython.
\item Horizontal drive: Stepper motor with Lego gearbox.
\item Hoist drive: Stepper motor with gearbox.
\end{itemize}

Signals of interest:
\[
x(t), \quad z_l(t), \quad m, \quad x_b, \quad h_b, \quad u_x(t), \quad u_z(t), \quad z_f(t), \quad z_b(t)
\]

A simplified conceptual layout is shown below.

\section{Project Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement closed-loop position control on both horizontal and vertical axes using the ESP32.
\item Detect and classify obstacles and determine the required clearance height $z_{\text{clear}} \ge h_b + \Delta$.
\item Execute a safe automated motion sequence: approach → lift → traverse → lower → stop.
\item Demonstrate reliable behavior under repeat trials and document system performance.
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Parameters}
Quantities treated as constants during operation include gravitational acceleration, approximate payload mass, rail length, hoist stroke limits, gearbox ratios, motor characteristics, available supply voltage, and estimated friction coefficients. These will be measured or estimated during early testing.

\section{Actuation and Control}
The ESP32 issues motor commands through driver interfaces (PWM and/or H-bridges). Low-level control loops (e.g., PID) will regulate $x(t)$ and $z(t)$. A supervisory state machine handles obstacle-handling logic and ensures minimum clearance margins.

If the suspended mass exhibits noticeable sway, optional input shaping or anti-swing techniques may be introduced.

\section{Modeling}
A simplified 2-DOF translational model is used initially:
\[
m \ddot{x} + b_x \dot{x} = \alpha_x u_x,\qquad
m \ddot{z} + b_z \dot{z} + m g = \alpha_z u_z
\]
More detailed models including cable sway are possible if required.

\section{Sensors and Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item ESP32 executes the control loop (20–200 Hz depending on sensor timing).
\item Ultrasonic sensors provide height data of the load and the clearance on both sides.
\item Software includes filtering, debouncing, safety interlocks, and height comparison between load height and surroundings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risks and Mitigation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensor noise or unreliable obstacle detection → mitigate by filtering and cross-checking.
\item CPU timing jitter → adjust loop rate, offload intensive steps where needed.
\item Mechanical play or load swing → speed limits, input shaping, or revised geometry.
\item Motor overload or collision risk → current limiting, soft limits, emergency stop.
\end{itemize}

\section{Schedule and Deliverables}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Week 1}: Complete mechanical design, order components, begin assembly.
    \item \textbf{Week 2}: Finish assembly and initial mechanical testing.
    \item \textbf{Week 3}: Integrate electrical systems and validate sensors.
    \item \textbf{Week 4}: Identify system parameters and tune PID controllers.
    \item \textbf{Week 5}: Implement automatic obstacle-handling logic and refine performance.
    \item \textbf{Week 6}: Conduct stress testing, finalize documentation, record demonstration video.
\end{enumerate}
